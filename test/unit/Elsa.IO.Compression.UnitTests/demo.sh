# Demo script to show the Elsa Compression Activities functionality
# This demonstrates the CreateZipArchive activity that's already implemented

echo "This repository contains a fully implemented compression module:"
echo "- Elsa.IO.Compression module with CreateZipArchive activity"
echo "- Support for multiple input formats: byte[], Stream, file path, file URL, base64, ZipEntry"
echo "- Configurable compression levels"
echo "- Stream-based output for use in workflows"

echo "Key features implemented:"
echo "✓ CreateZipArchive activity supports all required formats:"
echo "  - Byte arrays (byte[])"
echo "  - Streams (Stream)"
echo "  - File paths (string)"
echo "  - File URLs (string)"
echo "  - Base64 strings (string with 'base64:' prefix)"
echo "  - ZipEntry objects (with custom entry names)"
echo "  - Arrays of any of the above types"
echo ""

echo "✓ Configurable compression levels:"
echo "  - Optimal (default)"
echo "  - Fastest"
echo "  - SmallestSize"
echo "  - NoCompression"
echo ""

echo "✓ Stream-based output for workflow integration"
echo "✓ Proper error handling and logging"
echo "✓ Content resolution via IContentResolver service"

echo "Example usage patterns:"
echo ""
echo "1. Byte array entries:"
echo "   var entries = new object[] { "
echo "       Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Content 1\"),"
echo "       Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(\"Content 2\")"

echo "3. Base64 strings:"
echo "   var entries = new object[] { "
echo "       \"base64:\" + Convert.ToBase64String(bytes1),"
echo "       \"base64:\" + Convert.ToBase64String(bytes2)"
echo "   };"

echo "4. Mixed entry types:"
echo "   var entries = new object[] { "
echo "       byteArray,"
echo "       stream,"
echo "       new ZipEntry(content, \"custom.txt\"),"

echo "Next steps for expansion could include:"
echo "- Extract archive activity"
echo "- Update archive activity" 
echo "- List archive entries activity"
echo "- Remove entries activity"
echo "- Additional compression formats (gzip, tar, etc.)"
