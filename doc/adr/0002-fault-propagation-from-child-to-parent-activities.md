# 2. Fault Propagation from Child to Parent Activities

Date: 2025-04-01

## Status

Accepted

Amended by [3. Signal-Driven Fault Propagation](0003-signal-driven-fault-propagation.md)

## Context
When an activity throws an exception during execution, the `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` is responsible for handling the fault. In addition to logging the exception and recording an incident, it also explicitly faults all ancestor activities using the `GetAncestors()` method and calling `TransitionTo(ActivityStatus.Faulted)` on each one.

At the time of implementing this behavior, the rationale was likely to bubble up the fault status to ensure parent activities would not continue executing in an invalid or inconsistent state when one of their children failed. This was especially relevant in composite activities like `ForEach`, `Parallel`, or `Flowchart`, where upstream control logic may depend on the success or failure of child nodes.

However, this behavior causes unintended side effects when the faulted activity is later resumed and completes successfully. Since the parent (e.g., a `Flowchart`) was faulted earlier, it remains in a `Faulted` state, unaware that the child it depends on has now succeeded. As a result, the Flowchart itself never reaches `Completed`, and the entire workflow instance is stuck in `Faulted` or `Running`, depending on the selected fault strategy.

## Decision
The system will propagate a fault status to all ancestors of a faulted activity at the time of the exception, under the assumption that the workflow should not proceed normally when an unexpected error occurs in a child.

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Ensures that a fault in a child activity doesn't go unnoticed by parent activities.
- Allows composite activities to reflect a failed state immediately and consistently when one of their children fails.

### Negative:
- Parent activities may enter a `Faulted` state prematurely.
- If the child activity is later resumed and completes successfully, the parent remains unaware and cannot transition to `Completed`, causing the entire workflow to hang in a `Faulted` state.
- This is especially problematic for long-running, resumable workflows where faults are transient and may later be resolved.

## Alternatives Considered
- Do **not** fault ancestors automatically; let each composite activity decide how to handle faults from children.

---

**Follow-up actions:**
- Consider decoupling fault propagation from actual state transitionâ€”perhaps emit a signal instead and allow composite activities to opt in to fault bubbling.
