# 4. Direct Bookmark Management in WorkflowExecutionContext

Date: 2025-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context
Currently, `ActivityExecutionContext` maintains a temporary list of bookmarks created by the activity during its execution. After the activity completes, a middleware is responsible for copying these bookmarks into the `WorkflowExecutionContext.Bookmarks` list, which is then persisted to the database.

This architecture leads to a subtle issue upon resumption:
- When a workflow is resumed from a persisted state, only the `WorkflowExecutionContext` and its `Bookmarks` are restored from the database.
- The `ActivityExecutionContext`'s temporary `Bookmarks` list remains empty.
- As a result, if the resumed activity attempts to cancel (or modify) its previously created bookmarks, it cannot, because it has no access to themâ€”changes are not tracked.

## Decision
Eliminate the temporary `Bookmarks` list in `ActivityExecutionContext`. Instead, have activities add bookmarks directly to the `WorkflowExecutionContext.Bookmarks` list.

This is possible and safe because each `Bookmark` already contains:
- A reference to the originating `ActivityId`
- A reference to the originating `ActivityInstanceId`

These references allow accurate tracking and filtering of bookmarks, even when multiple activities are active.

## Consequences

- Simplifies the architecture by removing the need for middleware to copy bookmarks post-execution.
- Fixes a bug where resumed activities could not cancel their previously created bookmarks.
- Reduces the chance of inconsistencies between temporary and persisted bookmark state.
- Ensures bookmark changes are always applied to the persisted, canonical source of truth.

## Alternatives Considered
- Keep the existing temporary list and enhance the system to hydrate the `ActivityExecutionContext.Bookmarks` list on resume. Rejected due to added complexity and duplication of state.
