# Contributing to Elsa Workflows
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the New BSD License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [New BSD License](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/elsa-workflows/elsa-core/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
As a default, I am applying [Microsoft's Coding Conventions for .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-code-style-settings-reference).
