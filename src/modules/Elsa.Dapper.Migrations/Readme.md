# Migration versioning

Each migration's version number is prefixed with a numerical value that represents a given module.
The following table shows the mapping between module and version prefix:

| Module                 | Version prefix  |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Management             | 1000            |
| Runtime                | 2000            |
| Identity               | 3000            |

After the prefix comes the version of the migration. For example, the "Initial" migration is at version 1.
For the "Management" module, the "Initial" migration is at version 10001.
Similarly, the "Initial" migration for the "Runtime" module is at version 20001.
