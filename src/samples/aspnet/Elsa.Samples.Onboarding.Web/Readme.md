# Onboarding Sample

This application represents a simple task management application.
The tasks are created from a separate application, the workflow server.
The goal is for the user of this application to complete each task (by clicking the "Complete" button) and then move on to the next task.
As the user completes each task, the workflow server will automatically continue until the onboarding process is complete.
